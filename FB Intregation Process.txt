                !! Front and Backend ntregation !!

1. use transtack query for front and back intregation
    -> npm i @tanstack/react-query
2. notistack for error and success messages
    -> npm install notistack
3. Axios for api call
    -> npm install axios
4. setup react query and notistack using providers

//Connection between F-B
5. create index.js for api calls in http
6. create api intance of axios
7. create .env file with vite_backend_url http:// localhost:8000
8. add mutation fuctions for the connecting front with back
9.install cors and add that in Backend app.js
    -> npm i cors
10. define user slicer and use dispatch to move data
11. use dispatch in the loginMutation's onSuccess fuction
12. deliver the eact thing that needed to be passdown

    !! What i leatrnt FB Intregation !!
-> define slice in the redux store
-> define async func in the controller for action
-> add the route to the route.js
-> this way new api is created
-> intregate the api in the https-> index.js as function aka apicall function
-> use  a mutation function in the comp for intregation 
-> add the apicall funtion in the mutationFn
-> onSuccess: will hold dispatch call
-> data will be destructured and will be deliverde via dispacth call in onSuccess
-> onError will handle the errore with enquesnackBar
-> now the data from the Backend can be used with useSelector via redux store
